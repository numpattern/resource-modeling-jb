There exists vast bibliography on technical topics related to 
oil and mineral resource evaluation. This document does not intent to replace
any of the well-known and more detailed sources, rather it aims to gather 
current practices for resource evaluation and serve as a guide
to those who stay curious. This is not a conventional document that dive deep 
into the mathematical foundations, it keeps at a high level to be digestable 
for starting and more experienced professionals with multiple backgrounds 
in the resource industry. 

The author's intent is to present the variety of techniques at the stages of 
resource modeling and hopefully summarize teh changes in performance 
over the last decades. This document aims unbiasedness during
the presentation of results and no premise of preferences must be made, 
conclusions are left to careful readers. 

Often, practitioners must decide whether specific algorithms
suits their needs in terms of skills required, timing and affordability. 
It's the author's personal opinion that legacy technology must be upgraded. 
Industry and independent practitioners often do not see the need to replace
or upgrade. Some of the main reasons include costs and lack of effort. 
The costs may be associated to the interruption of normality and 
invesment; while laziness may include the ignorancance resulting from not 
training and the embracement of the old. Technical expertise should disclosed 
cyclically to encourage further development.
